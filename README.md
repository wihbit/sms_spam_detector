## Objectives
- Fit a TFIDF and CLF pipeline model on a dataset of 'spam' and 'ham' text messages
- Evaluate model accuracy and use the model to predict on new, sample messages
- Create a function to output this model
- Create a function to use this model to predict on any input text
- Integrate the function into a Gradio app that provides an easy GUI to input texts and see the model's output predictions.
